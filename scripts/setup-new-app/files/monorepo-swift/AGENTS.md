# Native app

- SwiftUI lives in `app-ios/`; read its `AGENTS.md` for native development. The root `start:ios` script delegates to `app-ios/scripts/run` and forwards launcher arguments.
- The web client lives in `app-web/`. Root `start` runs it and the server together. `start:client` and `start:server` run each individually; iOS runs separately.
- The root env-manager schema declares each directory target with explicit output paths: TypeScript values at `.env.local` and readers at `src/env.ts`, native values at `Config/LocalSecrets.xcconfig`. Regenerate the nested xcconfig with `env-manager gen --local`; never hand-edit `app-ios/Config/LocalSecrets.xcconfig`.
- `Config/Base.xcconfig` and `Config/Info.plist` bridge selected settings into `AppEnvironment.apiURL`. Native settings are bundled; server credentials belong exclusively to the server target.
