# {{APP_NAME}}

SwiftUI app for iOS 17+ and macOS 14+. Requires Bun and Xcode 16 or newer.

## Run

From this folder:

```sh
./scripts/run
```

The launcher selects a target and watches for changes. Edit `Sources/App` to rebuild and relaunch. Stop with Ctrl-C; use `--no-watch` for a single launch. Build errors leave the watcher running.

## Choose a target

```sh
./scripts/run --targets
./scripts/run -t simulator
./scripts/run -t "iPhone 17"
./scripts/run -t mac
```

`--targets` lists names and identifiers; `*` marks the default. Selection prefers a connected iOS device, then a booted simulator, an available simulator, or My Mac.

Set `SWIFT_RUN_DEFAULT_TARGET` to choose a default; `-t` overrides it. For duplicate simulator names, use an identifier to select exactly. Install simulator runtimes in Xcode's settings.

## Device signing

Pair the device in Xcode, enable Developer Mode, and unlock it. Configure automatic signing in Xcode or pass your team:

```sh
./scripts/run --team YOUR_TEAM_ID
```

You can also set `SWIFT_RUN_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`.

## Debug and build

Open `App.xcodeproj` and select the shared `App` scheme to debug. `swift build` checks the package on macOS; use the launcher for simulator builds and bundled resources.

Build logs are in `DerivedData/<target>/build.log`, where `<target>` is `device`, `simulator`, or `mac`. Temporary app state resets after relaunch.
